**LitLine Description**

A major issue that children with Dyslexia struggle with is reading large chunks of text at once. The
LitLine attempts to remedy this issue by isolating each line of text. It is an easily mass producible and
modifiable tool due to the fact that it is 3D printed. In addition, the material used to create the LitLine is
compostable non toxic PLA. All models of the tool are available on Thingiverse.com (https://
www.thingiverse.com/thing:5966347) for modification, and I distribute copies to local schools free of
charge.

**About Me**

I am currently a junior at Regis Jesuit high school, and I was diagnosed with dyslexia in first grade. I
greatly struggled with reading growing up and at times hated it due to the great confusion that I felt. I
have since realized the joy that reading can bring and the importance of reading without anger.
Recently my younger brother was also diagnosed with Dyslexia, and I hated to see his frustration when
reading. Thinking back on what helped me read when I was his age I remembered using a piece of
paper to isolate the line. This inspired me to create a more robust, permanent, and customizable tool to
isolate the line. I found that this benefitted my brother, so I decided to share it with the learning
services programs at other schools.
