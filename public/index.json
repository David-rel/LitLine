    "content": "A major issue that children with dyslexia struggle with is reading large chunks of text at once. The LitLine attempts to remedy this issue by isolating each line of text. It is an easily mass-producible and modifiable tool due to the fact that it is 3D printed. In addition, the material used to create the LitLine is compostable, non-toxic PLA. All models of the tool are available on Thingiverse.com for modification, and I distribute copies to local schools free of charge."
